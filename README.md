# **RelayX**

## Overview
RelayX is a **lightweight multi-agent orchestrator** that handles multiple specialized tasks through a managerâ€“sub-agent architecture.  
The system consists of:
- **Manager Agent**: Coordinates tasks and aggregates responses.
- **Sub-Agents**: Each focused on a specific domain.

---

## How It Works
The manager agent receives a user request, determines which sub-agent(s) should handle it, and then orchestrates their responses into a unified output.

### **Sub-Agents**
- **ðŸ¤“ funny_nerd** â€“ Tells nerdy jokes about various topics.
- **ðŸ“° news_analyst** â€“ Fetches and summarizes the latest news using a search tool.
- **ðŸ“ˆ stock_analyst** â€“ Looks up real-time stock prices.

---

## Key Features
- Modular **multi-agent architecture**.
- Each sub-agent returns a **structured response** (e.g., joke, news summary, stock info).
- Manager agent **combines and formats the final output**.
- Easily extensible â€“ add more agents for additional tasks.
